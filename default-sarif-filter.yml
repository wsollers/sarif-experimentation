# Items in `include` list are interpreted as inclusion filtering rules.
# Items are treated with OR operator, the filtered results includes objects matching any rule.
# Each item can be one rule or a list of rules, in the latter case rules in the list are treated
# with AND operator - all rules must match.
include:
  # The following line includes issues whose author-mail property contains "@microsoft.com" AND
  # found in Java files.
  # Values with special characters `\:;_()$%^@,` must be enclosed in quotes (single or double):
  - author-mail: "@microsoft.com"
    locations[*].physicalLocation.artifactLocation.uri: "*.java"
  # Instead of a substring, a regular expression can be used, enclosed in "/" characters.
  # Issues whose committer-mail property includes a string matching the regular expression are included.
  # Use ^ and $ to match the whole committer-mail property.
  - committer-mail:
      value: "/^<myname.*\\.com>$/"
      # Configuration options can be overridden for any rule.

  # The following line excludes issues whose location is in test Java files with names starting with
  #  the "Test" prefix.
  - location: "Test*.java"
  # The value for the property can be empty, in this case only existence of the property is checked.
